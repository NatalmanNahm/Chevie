        Free-agent wide receiver Antonio Brown is working out with the New Orleans Saints this morning,
        per Adam Schefter. The Saints have been without a legitimate number-two receiver next to Michael
        Thomas all year- and Brown would be more than capable. As Schefter stated, the Saints are doing their
        \"due diligence\", so it will be interesting to see what comes of the workout. Thomas and Brown have both caught at
        least 125 passes twice in their careers. Having them on the same team would be a nightmare for opposing DBs and a dream come
        true for Drew  Brees.
